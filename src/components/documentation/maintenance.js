        Cleaning <span className="font-louis">louis</span>
      </h3>
      <p>
        <span className="font-louis">louis</span> is surface washable, and can
        be cleaned with a cloth dampened with warm water. Please do not use
        abrasive chemicals such as bleach or certain cleaning products. Ensure{" "}
        <span className="font-louis">louis</span> is completely turned off, then
        wipe down the sides of the main controller and cells. The rotating discs
        in each cell can be cleaned by using the inbuilt Clean app. This will
        cause the disks in all cells to rotate continuously until the app is
        quit, allowing the disks to be cleaned.
      </p>
      <h3 id="cleaning-connectors">Cleaning the Connectors</h3>
      <p>
        To clean the connectors on the sides of the cells and main controller,
        use a can of compressed air (if available) to blow dirt out from the
        connecting pins and connectors. If no compressed air is available, use a
        soft brush to brush the contacts clean. Do not use a brush with wire
        bristles or other forms of hard brush as this can damage the
        connections.
      </p>
      <h3 id="replacing-battery">Replacing the Battery</h3>
      <p>
        The battery contained inside <span className="font-louis">louis</span>{" "}
        is rechargeable so should not need to be replaced, only recharged when
        it runs low. However, over some years the performance of the battery
        will decrease, this is to be expected and occurs with all rechargeable
        batteries. The battery, as with all components in{" "}
        <span className="font-louis">louis</span>, is a non-user serviceable
        part.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the time of writing this user guide, we do not offer battery
        replacement service. However, this is something we are continually
        considering, so please check our website for the latest information. In
        absence of a battery replacement service, when the battery performance
        has degraded beyond the point of use, we recommend taking{" "}
        <span className="font-louis">louis</span> your local electronics
        recycling centre.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the current time ThreeDots is not a member of the WEEE Distributor
        Take Back Scheme, and therefore we offer to recycle louis for you at no
        charge. Contact us for more information.

      <h3 id="calibrating-cell">Calibrating a Cellâ€™s Output</h3>
      <p>
        In rare occasions, the braille output displayed on a cell may become
        uncalibrated, meaning it does not display the correct output. This can
        be solved using the inbuilt Calibration app. To manually recalibrate a
        cell follow these steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Open the Calibration app.</li>
        <li>Place your hand on the faulty cell's output.</li>
        <li>
          Press the cell's button until the reading window outputs a space
          character (i.e.: a flat surface with no raised dots).
        </li>
        <li>
          Say <span className="italic underline">exit</span> or{" "}
          <span className="italic underline">quit</span> to finish the
          calibration.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        If a cell is becoming regularly uncalibrated, this may be due to a fault
        with the cell. If the cell is still under warranty, please contact us to
        arrange a replacement.
