Please do not use\n        abrasive chemicals such as bleach or certain cleaning products. Ensure{\" \"}\n        <span className=\"font-louis\">louis</span> is completely turned off, then\n        wipe down the sides of the main controller and cells. The rotating discs\n        in each cell can be cleaned by using the inbuilt Clean app. This will\n        cause the disks in all cells to rotate continuously until the app is\n        quit, allowing the disks to be cleaned.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"cleaning-connectors\">Cleaning the Connectors</h3>\n      <p>\n        To clean the connectors on the sides of the cells and main controller,\n        use a can of compressed air (if available) to blow dirt out from the\n        connecting pins and connectors. If no compressed air is available, use a\n        soft brush to brush the contacts clean. Do not use a brush with wire\n        bristles or other forms of hard brush as this can damage the\n        connections.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"replacing-battery\">Replacing the Battery</h3>\n      <p>\n        The battery contained inside <span className=\"font-louis\">louis</span>{\" \"}\n        is rechargeable so should not need to be replaced, only recharged when\n        it runs low. However, over some years the performance of the battery\n        will decrease, this is to be expected and occurs with all rechargeable\n        batteries. The battery, as with all components in{\" \"}\n        <span className=\"font-louis\">louis</span>, is a non-user serviceable\n        part.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the time of writing this user guide, we do not offer battery\n        replacement service. However, this is something we are continually\n        considering, so please check our website for the latest information. In\n        absence of a battery replacement service, when the battery performance\n        has degraded beyond the point of use, we recommend taking{\" \"}\n        <span className=\"font-louis\">louis</span> your local electronics\n        recycling centre.\n      </p>\n      <p>\n        At the current time ThreeDots is not a member of the WEEE Distributor\n        Take Back Scheme, and therefore we offer to recycle louis for you at no\n        charge. Contact us for more information.\n      </p>\n      <h3 id=\"calibrating-cell\">Calibrating a Cellâ€™s Output</h3>\n      <p>\n        In rare occasions, the braille output displayed on a cell may become\n        uncalibrated, meaning it does not display the correct output. This can\n        be solved using the inbuilt Calibration app. To manually recalibrate a\n        cell follow these steps:\n      </p>\n      <ol>\n        <li>Open the Calibration app.</li>\n        <li>Place your hand on the faulty cell's output.</li>\n        <li>\n          Press the cell's button until the reading window outputs a space\n          character (i.e.: a flat surface with no raised dots).\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          Say <span className=\"italic underline\">exit</span> or{\" \"}\n          <span className=\"italic underline\">quit</span> to finish the\n          calibration.\n        </li>\n      </ol>\n      <p>\n        If a cell is becoming regularly uncalibrated, this may be due to a fault\n        with the cell. If the cell is still under warranty, please contact us to\n        arrange a replacement.\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  )\n}\n\nexport default Maintenance\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
