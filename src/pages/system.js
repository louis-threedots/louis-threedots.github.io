          When creating <span className="font-louis">louis</span>, we were keen to make something that was bigger than our team. A product which, through 3rd party developers, could be expanded and used in ways which we have not even imagined yet.
          Our open APK means that developers without an understanding of the low-level workings of the system (or even without a <span className="font-louis">louis</span> system themselves) can develop apps that are as deep and complex as they like. <br/>Our vision was always to make a device that could be used throughout a userâ€™s braille literacy journey, starting with learning, and ending as a usable and cheap braille display. With more precise machinery and production techniques, our product could be minituarised further, which would open up the possibility of an even more practical display for graduates of our learning apps.
