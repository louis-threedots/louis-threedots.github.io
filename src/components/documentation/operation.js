    <h3 id="general">Charge <span className="font-louis">louis</span></h3>
    <p>
      Once you hear the phrase: "low battery", then that means that{" "}
      <span className="font-louis">louis</span> needs recharging.
      You can find the charging port below the on/off switch on the main controller.
      Insert the charging cable to recharge the battery of{" "}
      <span className="font-louis">louis</span>. <strong>Important</strong>: you
      do not need to charge the cells, only the main controller.
    </p>
    <h3 id="general">Switch on</h3>
    <p>
      To turn <span className="font-louis">louis</span> on, press the on/off switch on the left side of the main controller.
      Once <span className="font-louis">louis</span> is switched on, you will hear the welcoming message: 
      "Welcome to <span className="font-louis">louis</span> the brailliant assistant."
    </p>
    <p>
      TODO fancy quote style?
      If this is your first time opening <span className="font-louis">louis</span>, then you will also hear:<br />
      "You can get more information and instructions by saying <span className="italic underline">help</span>.<br />
      You can quit <span className="font-louis">louis</span> and apps at any time by saying <span className="italic underline">quit</span> or <span className="italic underline">exit</span>.<br />
      You can hear your voice command options by saying <span className="italic underline">options</span>.<br />
      You can change settings by saying <span className="italic underline">settings</span>."
    </p>
    <h3 id="general">Switch off</h3>
    <p>
      To turn off, simply press the on/off switch while <span className="font-louis">louis</span> is on.
      You can also switch off <span className="font-louis">louis</span> by saying{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">quit</span> or <span className="italic underline">exit</span> when in the main menu.
    </p>
    <h3 id="open-an-application">Open an Application</h3>
    <p>
      When you are in the main menu, you will hear the phrase: "You can now
      open any application using voice command". You can then open any application
      of <span className="font-louis">louis</span> you want using the keyword{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">open</span> and the name of the application you
      wish to open. For example, letâ€™s say you wish to open the Learn app. You would
      use the phrase <span className="italic underline">open Learn</span> in order to do that.
    </p>
    <h3 id="close-an-application">Close an Application</h3>
    <p>
      To exit an app back to the main menu, you need to use either one of the
      keywords <span className="italic underline">exit</span> or{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">quit</span>. Thus if you are in the
      Learn app and wish to close it, you would say{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">exit</span> or{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">quit</span> to go back to the main
      menu.
    </p>
    <h3 id="help">Help</h3>
    <p>
      You can hear your voice command options by saying <span className="italic underline">options</span>.
      While in the main menu, <span className="italic underline">options</span> will give you the list of apps installed.
      In a specific app, <span className="italic underline">options</span> will give you the specific commands you can execute in the app.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you are in the main menu and wish to hear instructions of how to navigate <span className="font-louis">louis</span>, 
      you need to say <span className="italic underline">instructions</span> or <span className="italic underline">help</span>.
      This would read the instructions for you. If at any point you wish to hear the instructions for a specific app,
      you can do that by saying the word <span className="italic underline">instructions</span> or <span className="italic underline">help</span> while in the app.
    </p>
    <h3 id="pagination">Pagination</h3>
    <p>
      If you are using an app that requires you to read multiple words or
      lines of a text, you can scroll to the next line by pressing the button on
      the last cell. If you wish to move to the previous line, then press the
      button of the first cell.
    </p>
    <h3 id="contractions">Contractions</h3>
    <p>
      You can enable or disable contractions by opening the settings menu while
      in the main menu, by saying{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">settings</span>. Then it will ask you
      which setting you want to change, to which you should say{" "}
      <span className="italic underline">contractions</span>. Then you can
      either say <span className="italic underline">enable contractions</span>{" "}
      or <span className="italic underline">disable contractions</span>.
